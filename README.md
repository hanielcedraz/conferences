Conference talks I've given.

## Jan 20, 2016 ExploreTech, Toronto

I was invited by a coworker to give a talk at [ExploreTech](https://www.meetup.com/ExploreTech-Toronto/), a Toronto-based MeetUp about the lessons learned in setting up a new secure server environment. The title of the talk is "Starting Over: Designing a new server environment from scratch using lessons of old environments." The slide deck can be found [on Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/thedoh/starting-over-designing-a-new-server-environment-from-scratch-using-lessons-of-old-environments).

There is no recorded video.

## May 17, 2018 DevOpsDays Silicon Valley, Mountain View

I was invited by Jennifer Davis, co-author of _[Effective DevOps: Building a Culture of Collaboration, Affinity, and Tooling at Scale](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039846.do)_, to give a talk at DevOpsDays Silicon Valley. I had mentioned working on a talk about how my employer (my team, specifically) had come up with one of its first SLOs (Service Level Objectives) and she expressed an interest in hearing it at the conference.

The talk is called "SLO Creation And You: Or, How We Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Queue Length." Slides can be found at [on Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/thedoh/slos-and-you-or-how-we-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-queue-length). recorded video is forthcoming. Here is a [link to my speaker page for the conference](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-silicon-valley/program/lisa-seelye/)

[A recording of the talk](dod18video) is available on YouTube.com. (Kindly ignore the "floating head" style video; I wasn't aware it would turn out like that beforehand.)

## October 24, 2018 ExploreTech, Toronto

I was invited back by one of the organizers to give the SLO talk I gave in Silicon Valley back in May. The material is largely the same as DevOpsDays back in May, but with edits for clarity. Slides up at [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/thedoh/slo-creation-and-you-or-how-we-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-queue-length)
